# When the Vibes Start Fading: Real Challenges of AI Coding Assistance

AI coding assistants promise faster delivery and less boilerplate. In real projects, the limits show up as soon as the work goes beyond trivial edits. The following analysis sets out the terms, the mechanics of how assistants see code, and the consequences that follow—without anecdotes, hype, or padding.

## Terms

A *session* is a continuous interaction in which an assistant receives files and messages and produces answers or code. *Complete-bundle* means all relevant project files are provided to the assistant at the start, so it begins with a single, comprehensive snapshot. *Vibe Coding* means the assistant initially receives no project files and acquires knowledge gradually as specific files are opened or requested during the conversation. The *context window* is the maximum text the model can hold at one time; while material fits, nothing is removed. Once additions would exceed that limit, earlier details cannot remain fully available in active memory. *Retrieval* or *search* refers to the auxiliary mechanisms an assistant uses to locate and load code—by filename, token, or textual pattern—into the session.

## How assistants encounter a codebase

In practice there are only two access patterns. In a complete-bundle, the assistant is given the entire code bundle at the outset and thus starts with a unified view of the project. In Vibe Coding, material arrives incrementally; the assistant constructs its picture of the system as the conversation touches different areas. The distinction is simple: either the assistant begins with a whole snapshot, or it assembles one on the fly and never truly holds the entire system in memory at once.

## First practical observations

When assistants are asked to carry out non-trivial changes, characteristic failures appear quickly. Code that looks reasonable does not compile. Suggested changes reference configuration parameters that do not exist or call functions the project never defined. Because the presentation is uniformly confident, superficial plausibility is easy to mistake for reliability, and every suggestion requires careful review even when it appears routine.

## Why this happens

Large language models generate by probabilistic continuation rather than by proof. They reproduce local naming and style, but correctness depends on constraints that may not be represented in the active context. A typical misstep is an execution-context mix-up: a function that is correct on the server is recommended for a client-side form because the assistant recognized the label “validation” and missed where that function is permitted to run. Availability of text is not equivalent to understanding of applicability.

## Context windows in practice

A context window is a hard size limit. In a true complete-bundle that fits, nothing is dropped during the session; if the bundle does not fit, truncation or summarization must occur before the session begins, which by definition means it is no longer a true bundle. In Vibe Coding, files and messages accumulate over time. Once the total would overflow the window, earlier details fall outside active memory; some tools replace evicted segments with brief summaries. At this point the assistant pivots toward project-wide pattern search—internal lookups akin to a powerful grep across the codebase. It can still surface definitions and strings quickly, but the relationships between files fade. Reasoning drifts from a coherent architectural view to working off isolated text hits, which in turn encourages repeated searching of ground that was already covered.

## Planning under uncertainty

Most assistants do not disclose remaining capacity. Teams cannot tell when a session is close to the limit, and long, cross-file changes become difficult to stage. Hidden token ceilings can end a conversation abruptly, introducing operational risk and a practical form of lock-in: a central tool in the workflow may stop at an unspecified boundary, regardless of project urgency.

## Efficiency in day-to-day work

The promise of speed often gives way to coordination overhead. Developers re-supply files the assistant has aged out of memory, restate rules the assistant has partially forgotten, and verify output that looked correct but fails basic checks. The cumulative cost—clarifying patterns, correcting assumptions, and re-running reviews—frequently approaches or exceeds the effort required to implement the change directly.

## The documentation paradox

Good documentation helps initially, because the assistant can quote structure and rationale. As the session grows, detailed passages are first to be displaced from active memory or condensed into summaries. The assistant’s tone remains uniformly confident while critical specifics have already slipped out of view. Attempts to recover richness by re-reading the same documents consume capacity without restoring the original architectural continuity.

## Security implications

Probabilistic generation introduces security risk. Assistants can suggest unparameterized queries that invite injection, overlook input validation that prevents cross-site scripting, or assemble fragile authentication flows. Because every snippet is presented with steady confidence, subtle flaws are easy to miss. Training data can also encode insecure patterns. As a result, AI-generated changes should be treated like contributions from an unknown external source: subject to rigorous code review and backed by deterministic scanning with tools such as CodeQL, SonarQube, or Veracode.

## Why complete-bundle is the best start—and still insufficient

Supplying everything up front is the strongest initial condition. The assistant can see all files together, there is no early memory pressure, and no retrieval lag. Yet generation remains probabilistic. Misapplication of patterns can occur even when every relevant file is present; having the information is not the same as applying it correctly.

## Workflow mismatch

Modern development is iterative and stateful. Teams make cross-file edits, run tests and builds continuously, debug against live state, and rely on tools that track changes. Assistants operate on session snapshots with limited persistence across conversations, modest awareness of file-system events, and weak integration with test and build pipelines. The mismatch makes long-running refactors and architecture-level changes brittle, because the assistant cannot reliably carry the evolving state forward.

## What today’s assistants lack

Dependable work on large systems requires persistent memory across sessions, retrieval that preserves architectural relationships rather than only matching tokens, transparent indicators of remaining headroom, and proper integration with development tooling so suggestions can be grounded in executable state. Without these capabilities, assistants remain closer to fast pattern matchers than to colleagues who hold a system steadily in mind.

## Appropriate use and boundaries

The tools do deliver value when they stay within predictable lanes: generating conventional scaffolding, translating or explaining unfamiliar code, exploring new libraries, and supporting greenfield projects that follow clear, standard patterns. Outside those lanes—established codebases with domain-specific conventions, cross-component refactors that need sustained context, architectural decisions with cross-cutting constraints, and performance work that demands system-wide insight—the limitations dominate.

## Recognizing when to stop

Certain signals indicate that continuing will cost more than it saves: references to undefined parameters or functions, code that does not compile, stylistic alignment that conflicts with domain rules, repeated re-searching of material already seen, and review time rising to match implementation time. At that point, pausing the assistant, narrowing scope, or proceeding manually is usually the rational choice.

## Conclusion

Whether an assistant begins with a complete-bundle snapshot or constructs its view through Vibe Coding, two fundamentals govern outcomes: bounded context and probabilistic generation. The first constrains how much detail can be carried forward; the second makes superficially correct code easy to produce and easy to trust. Complete-bundle offers the best start and still cannot guarantee correct application of project-specific rules. Vibe Coding scales to large codebases but tends toward project-wide pattern search once the window is pressured, trading architectural coherence for fast text matches. Used deliberately—with static analysis, rigorous review, and realistic scope—assistants remain useful for exploration, explanation, and routine code. Expecting them to handle domain logic, sustained multi-file changes, or security-critical work reliably is where the vibes fade.
