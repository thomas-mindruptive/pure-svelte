# Project Summary: A Data Management Web Application

## **1. Core Objective**

The goal is to build a web application for managing business data, specifically "Suppliers" (Wholesalers) and their related information. The application needs to handle thousands of records efficiently, providing a fast user experience for viewing, creating, and editing data. The architecture must be robust, maintainable, and avoid unnecessary database load.

## **2. Technology Stack & Key Libraries**

*   **Framework:** SvelteKit (SSR Enabled), **Achte besonders auf: Svelte VERSION 5 - RUNES!!!!!**
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
*   **Styling:** Global CSS with CSS Variables (`src/app.css`) and component-scoped styles.
*   **Key Libraries:**
    *   `mssql`: The Node.js driver for connecting to the SQL Server.
    *   `uuid`: For generating unique transaction keys.
    *   `lodash-es`: For utility functions like `debounce`.
    *   `devalue`: For correctly parsing complex data structures from SvelteKit actions.
    *   `pino`: For high-performance, structured server-side logging.

## **3. Core Architectural Decisions & Patterns**

1.  **Generic Query API (`/api/query`):** A single, secure generic endpoint accepts a JSON `QueryPayload` to describe the desired query. This keeps the backend DRY and flexible.
2.  **URL-Driven State:** The state of the main supplier list (filtering, sorting) is stored in the URL's search parameters, making the application state bookmarkable, shareable, and robust.
3.  **Reusable "Dumb" Components (`Datagrid.svelte`):** A generic `Datagrid` component is used for all grid-based data displays (Supplier List, Category List). It is purely presentational, receiving data as props and emitting events for actions, ensuring maximum reusability and separation of concerns.
4.  **Promise-Based Confirmation Dialog:** User confirmations (e.g., for deletion) are handled by a global, non-blocking dialog component. It is triggered by a store and returns a promise, allowing any component to `await` a user's decision with a clean `async/await` syntax, replacing the blocking browser `confirm()`.
5.  **Robust Manual Fetch for Actions:** Client-side logic calls server actions using manual `fetch` requests. This pattern requires careful handling of the response, which is first parsed as JSON and then its `data` payload is parsed with `devalue` to correctly reconstruct complex server-side objects.
6.  **Isomorphic Logging:** A universal logger utility provides a consistent `log.info()`, `log.error()` API across the entire application. It intelligently uses the high-performance `pino` library on the server and falls back to the native `console` in the browser, with tree-shaking ensuring `pino` is never included in the client bundle.

## **5. Current Status & Functionality**

*   **Supplier List (`/suppliers`):**
    *   Displays a list of suppliers in a reusable, sortable `Datagrid`.
    *   Features client-side filtering and sorting by updating URL parameters.
    *   Includes a robust, multi-stage delete functionality with dependency detection and a cascade delete option.
*   **Edit Supplier Page (`/suppliers/[id]`):**
    *   Loads and displays all master data for a single supplier.
    *   Allows editing and saving of master data.
    *   **Features an advanced category management section:**
        *   Displays assigned categories in the same reusable `Datagrid` component for a consistent UX.
        *   Allows adding and removing categories.
        *   **Implements a full cascade delete workflow for categories:** It detects dependent "Offerings" and prompts the user to delete them transactionally if they wish to proceed.
*   **UI System:**
    *   A global "snackbar" system provides non-intrusive feedback for actions.
    *   A global confirmation dialog provides a modern, non-blocking user confirmation experience for destructive actions.

## **6. Key Technical Enhancements**

### **6.1 Advanced Delete Functionality (for Suppliers & Categories)**
*   **Full Dependency Detection:** The system automatically detects when a supplier or a category assignment has related data (offerings, links, attributes) and prevents simple deletion.
*   **Transactional Cascade Delete:** For both suppliers and categories, users are offered a "Cascade Delete" option when dependencies are found. This operation removes the target record and all its dependent data in a single, safe database transaction.
*   **Smart, Multi-Stage Workflow:**
    1.  User clicks delete → A non-blocking confirmation dialog appears.
    2.  If confirmed, a request is sent to the server.
    3.  The server checks for dependencies within a transaction.
    4.  If dependencies exist, the server responds with a `fail()` containing a `showCascadeOption: true` flag.
    5.  The client parses this response and shows a second, more detailed confirmation dialog asking for a cascade delete.
    6.  If confirmed again, a new request with `cascade=true` is sent to the server to execute the transactional cascade delete.

### **6.2 Robust Client-Server Communication**
*   **`devalue` Deserialization:** The client-side `fetch` handlers now correctly handle SvelteKit's response serialization. They first parse the outer JSON response, then use `devalue.parse()` on the `data` property to perfectly reconstruct the original server-side object, whether it's a success or a `fail()` payload. This handles complex data structures, circular references, and prevents parsing errors.
*   **Graceful Crash Handling:** The client-side `fetch` logic is wrapped in an additional `try...catch` block that can handle cases where the server has a critical crash and returns a non-`devalue` response (e.g., a plain JSON error or an HTML page), preventing the client from crashing and showing a user-friendly error instead.

### **6.3 Code Architecture & Reusability**
*   **Component-Driven UI:** The manual `<table>` for categories has been refactored into the reusable `Datagrid.svelte` component, creating a consistent look and feel and centralizing the grid logic in one place.
*   **Centralized State Management:** Global UI concerns like notifications and confirmations are handled via Svelte stores, decoupling the components and allowing any part of the application to trigger them.

## **7. Key Considerations**

*   **Manual `fetch` vs. `use:enhance`:** This project uses manual `fetch` calls to server actions. This provides maximum control over the request/response flow but requires manual implementation of response parsing (including `devalue`), loading state management, and error handling. The alternative, `use:enhance`, automates much of this but offers less granular control.
*   **`devalue` Serialization:** A key learning is that SvelteKit actions serialize their responses with `devalue`, which can result in a "double-serialized" payload (a `devalue` string inside a JSON string). Client-side code using `fetch` **must** account for this by first parsing the JSON, then parsing the resulting data string with `devalue`.

## **8. Architecture Benefits**

This architecture provides:
*   **Scalability & Maintainability:** The generic API and reusable UI components (`Datagrid`, `ConfirmDialog`) allow for rapid and consistent feature development.
*   **Performance:** Efficient SSR for the initial load combined with client-side state management for subsequent interactions.
*   **Superior User Experience:** Smooth, non-blocking interactions with real-time feedback, loading states, and clear, detailed confirmation flows.
*   **Data Integrity:** All destructive operations are wrapped in database transactions to ensure consistency.
*   **Type Safety & Modern Practices:** Full TypeScript integration with modern Svelte patterns.
