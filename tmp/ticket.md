### **Title: DX: Non-local changes in `+layout.ts` create a cascade of misleading type errors that obscure the true root cause**

**Describe the bug or feature request**

This issue describes a critical developer experience (DX) problem where a minor refactoring in a parent `+layout.ts` can trigger a cascade of TypeScript errors in child routes. The nature of these errors is misleading, causing developers to look for the problem in the wrong place and ultimately encouraging practices that weaken type safety.

This behavior undermines the reliability of SvelteKit's static analysis and makes debugging complex, deeply nested applications incredibly difficult.

**The Developer's Frustrating Debugging Journey**

Here is the step-by-step experience that illustrates the problem:

1.  **The Trigger:** A developer refactors the `load` function in a parent layout (e.g., `/(browser)/+layout.ts`) to simplify its logic. The external contract (return type) of the function remains unchanged.

2.  **The Symptom (First Misleading Error):** Suddenly, a compilation error appears in a completely unrelated child page component, for example, `.../offerings/[offeringId]/attributes/+page.svelte`:
    ```
    Error: Type 'PageData' is not assignable to type 'LoadData'.
      Property 'availableProducts' is optional in type '{...}' but required in type 'LoadData'. (ts)
    ```
    The developer's first instinct is to check the component and its direct `+page.ts` file. They spend time analyzing the props and the `LoadData` type, assuming the error is local.

3.  **The Chain of Discovery:** After some investigation, the developer realizes that the error is caused by a mismatch between what the page's `load` function in `.../attributes/+page.ts` returns and what the component's `LoadData` type expects. The `load` function was missing the `availableProducts` property. **The crucial insight here is that this was a pre-existing, latent bug that was not caught by the compiler before the layout change.** The developer fixes this by adding the missing property to the `return` statement.

4.  **The Second, Deeper Symptom:** A new, similar error now appears in another child route, e.g., `.../offerings/[offeringId]/links/+page.svelte`:
    ```
    Error: Type 'PageData' is not assignable to type 'LoadData'.
      Types of property 'offering' are incompatible.
        Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'WholesalerItemOffering_ProductDef_Category'. (ts)
    ```
    Again, the developer is forced to trace the data flow. They discover that the `.../links/+page.ts` `load` function has a code path (for a "create" mode) that can return `offering: null`. However, the component's `LoadData` type in `.../links/+page.svelte` strictly expects an `offering` object.

5.  **The Perverse Incentive (The Core DX Problem):** To fix this compile-time error, the developer follows the compiler's suggestion and modifies the component's type definition:
    ```typescript
    // In .../links/+page.svelte
    type LoadData = {
      // The type is widened to satisfy the compiler
      offering?: WholesalerItemOffering_ProductDef_Category | null;
      links: WholesalerOfferingLink[];
      // ...
    };
    ```
    The compilation error disappears. **However, the application is now less safe.** The underlying problem has been shifted from compile-time to runtime. As we've seen, code within the component that accesses `data.offering.id` without a null check will now cause a runtime crash (`TypeError: Cannot read properties of null`). The compiler does not flag this, effectively bypassing static type safety within the component's script and template.

**Why This is a "Global Magic Chaos"**

This entire debugging journey happens because the `PageData` object is an implicit, magical context. The change in the parent layout altered the precision of SvelteKit's automatic type generation for `PageData`. This new, more precise type correctly exposed the latent bugs in the child pages.

However, from a developer's perspective:
*   The system feels unpredictable. Type checking should be consistent, not dependent on the implementation details of a parent layout.
*   The error messages are non-local and misleading, pointing away from the true trigger (the layout change).
*   The "easiest" fix suggested by the compiler (widening the types with `| null`) actively encourages developers to write less safe code by shifting problems to runtime.

**Expected behavior**

1.  **Consistent Static Analysis:** The strictness of TypeScript checking should be consistent and not depend on the implementation details of a parent layout's `load` function. Latent type errors should be caught reliably.
2.  **Robust Template Typing:** The compiler should rigorously check for potential null/undefined access within templates and script blocks, especially after a type has been explicitly widened to include `null` or `?`.
3.  **Locality and Transparency:** The system should strive to report errors where they originate or at least provide better diagnostics that link a non-local trigger to its effect.

**System Info**
*   SvelteKit version: [Your version here, e.g., `@sveltejs/kit@2.5.0`]
*   Svelte version: [Your version here, e.g., `svelte@5.0.0-next.123`]
*   TypeScript version: [Your version here, e.g., `5.4.5`]
*   OS: [Your OS]
*   `tsconfig.json` settings: `strict: true`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`

This behavior forces developers into a frustrating cycle of chasing non-local errors and ultimately encourages them to weaken their application's type safety to appease the compiler. Improving the predictability and transparency of the type system would be a significant enhancement for professional SvelteKit development.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you for looking into this. The automatic type generation is a fantastic feature, and improving the predictability of the type inference would make it even more powerful and intuitive.
