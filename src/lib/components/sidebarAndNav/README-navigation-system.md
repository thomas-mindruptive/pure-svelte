# **Hierarchy Navigation System - Complete Documentation**

### **Executive Summary: The Refactoring Mandate**

This document outlines the refactoring of the application's core navigation system. The previous implementation attempted to derive the user's navigation path by interpreting a loose collection of URL parameters (`urlParams`). This approach was complex, ambiguous, and led to persistent bugs like "Context Leaking".

The new architecture is based on a single, simple principle: **The `url.pathname` is the definitive source of truth.**

We are moving from a system that *guesses* the path to one that *translates* the unambiguous URL path directly. This document details the target architecture and the precise steps required to complete this critical refactoring.

---

## **Core Concepts & Definitions**

A precise understanding of these terms is critical.

1.  **URL / Route**: The address in the browser's address bar. The `url.pathname` (e.g., `/suppliers/3/categories`) is the primary, unambiguous source of truth for constructing the navigation path.

2.  **Navigation Context (Primitive Path)**: The application's "memory", stored in the `NavigationState`. It is a simple, serializable array of strings and numbers that represents the user's drill-down path (e.g., `['suppliers', 3, 'categories', 5]`). It is the definitive record of the user's location.

3.  **Rich Node Path (`nodesOnPath`)**: A temporary, in-memory array of the full `RuntimeHierarchyTreeNode` objects. It is created during the `load` function by translating the **Primitive Path** into a list of rich objects. This is the data structure that most UI-facing functions will consume.

4.  **Active View (Active Node)**: A pure **UI concept**. It is the single `RuntimeHierarchyTreeNode` that is marked or highlighted as "current" in the user interface (e.g., in the sidebar). It is determined *after* the Rich Node Path has been built.

5.  **`defaultChild`**: A configuration property on a node. Its **sole purpose** is to influence the determination of the `activeNode`. It has **no influence** on the creation of the navigation context.

6.  **Context Preservation**: The core feature. If a user navigates to a URL whose path is a "prefix" of the currently stored context path, the deeper, stored context is preserved.

7.  **Context Reset**: Occurs when a user navigates to a URL whose path diverges from the stored context. The URL's path becomes the new, definitive context.

8.  **Hierarchy Types: `type: "list"` | `"object"`**: A property that serves primarily as a **UI and semantic hint**.
    *   **Core Logic:** The core path-building logic is agnostic to this type.
    *   **UI Logic (`buildBreadcrumb.ts`):** This is where the type is critical to decide between rendering a static label or a dynamic entity name.

## **Complete Navigation Flow - A Correct Example**

This table shows how the state changes in the **target architecture**, illustrating the strict separation of **Context** and **View**.

| User Action                                       | URL                                   | **Primitive Path in `navState`** <br> *The truth of the data location* | **Rich Node Path (`nodesOnPath`)** <br> *Used by UI functions* | **Active View (`activeNode`)** <br> *The UI's recommendation* |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------| :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start:** Lands on the suppliers list.      | `/suppliers`                          | `['suppliers']`                                                         | `[suppliersNode]` |`suppliersNode` |
| **1. Entity Selection:** Clicks "Supplier C" (ID=3). | `/suppliers/3`                        | `['suppliers', 3]`                                            | `[suppliersNode, supplierNode(3)]` | `categoriesNode` **(due to `defaultChild`)**          |
| **2. Back-Navigation:** Clicks "Suppliers" in the sidebar. | `/suppliers`                          | `['suppliers', 3]` <br> **(CONTEXT IS PRESERVED!)** | `[suppliersNode, supplierNode(3)]` | `suppliersNode` **(due to explicit UI click)**                 |

## **Architecture & Implementation Details**

### **The "Brain": `+layout.ts` `load` function - Conceptual Flow**

This is the exact, multi-context-aware flow that must be implemented.

**Input:** The `url` object from SvelteKit, and the `currentNavState` from our store.

#### **Phase 1: Reconciliation (Deciding between Preservation and Reset)**

1.  **Determine the Current Context:** Extract the first segment of the URL path (e.g., `"suppliers"`) to identify the relevant context.
2.  **Gather Competing Paths:** Get the `urlPrimitivePath` from the new URL and the `preservedPrimitivePath` from the `navState` for the current context.
3.  **Compare and Decide:** A `reconcilePaths` utility determines the `definitivePrimitivePath`. If the URL path is a prefix of the preserved path, the longer preserved path is used (Preservation). Otherwise, the new URL path wins (Reset).

#### **Phase 2: State Update and Data Preparation**

4.  **Update State with the Definitive Path:** The reconciled `definitivePrimitivePath` is saved to the `navState` for the current context.
5.  **Translate Primitive Path to Rich Node Path:** The single, authoritative `findNodesForPath` utility is called. It takes the definitive primitive path and the correct tree, and returns the `nodesOnPath` array of rich `RuntimeHierarchyTreeNode` objects.

#### **Phase 3: UI State Update**

6.  **Update Disabled States:** The `updateDisabledStates` function consumes the `nodesOnPath` to enable/disable nodes in the entire tree.
7.  **Determine the Active Node:** The `determineActiveNode` function consumes the `nodesOnPath` and `url` to determine which node to highlight.
8.  **Build Breadcrumbs:** The `buildBreadcrumb` function consumes the `nodesOnPath` to build the breadcrumb items.

### **Drilling Deeper: Context Preservation vs. Context Reset**

The core of the navigation logic lies in its ability to intelligently decide whether to preserve the user's deep navigation context or to reset it. This decision is made by the `reconcilePaths` utility at the very beginning of every `load` function.

#### **What is being compared?**

On every navigation, we compare two primitive paths:

1.  **`urlPrimitivePath`:** The path derived directly from the browser's new URL. This represents the user's **immediate intent**.
2.  **`preservedPrimitivePath`:** The full, deep path currently stored in the `navState` for the relevant context. This represents the application's **memory**.

The decision logic is based on a simple comparison: **Is the `urlPrimitivePath` a "prefix" of the `preservedPrimitivePath`?**

---

#### **Scenario 1: Context Preservation (The "Prefix" Match)**

Context Preservation occurs when the user navigates "up" the hierarchy to a page they have already passed through.

*   **Rule:** If the `urlPrimitivePath` is an identical starting sub-sequence of the `preservedPrimitivePath`, the context is preserved.

*   **Example:**
    *   **Current State (`preservedPrimitivePath`):** `['suppliers', 5, 'categories', 1, 'offerings', 3]`
    *   **User Action:** The user clicks on the "Categories" item in the sidebar.
    *   **New URL:** `/suppliers/5/categories/1`
    *   **`urlPrimitivePath`:** `['suppliers', 5, 'categories', 1]`

*   **The Check:** Is `['suppliers', 5, 'categories', 1]` a prefix of `['suppliers', 5, 'categories', 1, 'offerings', 3]`? **Yes.**
*   **Result:** The `reconcilePaths` function returns the longer, **preserved path**. The application's memory of being deep inside "Offering 3" is maintained.

---

#### **Scenario 2: Context Reset (No "Prefix" Match)**

A Context Reset occurs when the user selects a *different entity* at the same or a higher level, creating a divergent path.

*   **Rule:** If the `urlPrimitivePath` is **not** a prefix of the `preservedPrimitivePath`, the context is reset.

*   **Example:**
    *   **Current State (`preservedPrimitivePath`):** `['suppliers', 5, 'categories', 1, 'offerings', 3]`
    *   **User Action:** The user navigates back to the main supplier list and clicks on a different supplier, "Supplier 1".
    *   **New URL:** `/suppliers/1`
    *   **`urlPrimitivePath`:** `['suppliers', 1]`

*   **The Check:** Is `['suppliers', 1]` a prefix of `['suppliers', 5, 'categories', 1, 'offerings', 3]`? **No.** (The paths diverge at the second element: `1` vs. `5`).
*   **Result:** The `reconcilePaths` function returns the shorter, **new URL path**: `['suppliers', 1]`. The entire deep context is correctly discarded.

### **Type-Safe Hierarchy System (`HierarchySidebar.types.ts`)**

The foundation of the system is a set of generic TypeScript types that enforce correctness at compile time. This prevents errors like referencing non-existent children.

```typescript
// Generic types with compile-time validation for defaultChild
export type HierarchyTreeNode<K extends string, C extends readonly HierarchyTreeNode<any, any>[] | undefined> = {
  item: HierarchyItem<K>;
  defaultChild?: C extends readonly any[] ? C[number]["item"]["key"] : never;
  children?: C;
};

// Helper function for strict type inference
export const createHierarchyNode = <const K extends string, const C extends readonly HierarchyTreeNode<any, any>[] | undefined>(node: {
  /* ... */
}): HierarchyTreeNode<K, C> => node;
```
This ensures that a `defaultChild` value must be a key of one of the nodes in the `children` array.

### **Configuration vs. Runtime Separation**

*   **Configuration (`navHierarchyConfig.ts`):** Defines the static node structure of the navigation trees. This is the single source of truth for paths and relationships.
*   **Runtime (`RuntimeHierarchyTree`):** During the `load` process, the static configuration is transformed into a runtime tree and enriched with dynamic data (`level`, `urlParamValue`, `disabled`).

### **State Management: `navigationState.ts`**

*   The Svelte store (`navigationState`) holds the state across navigations.
*   `activeTree.paths` (to be refactored): Will store the primitive path.
*   `activeViewNode` (to be refactored): Will store the active node's key.

### **UI Interaction: `+layout.svelte`**
*   The `handleSidebarNavigation` function is the "sender of intent".
*   On a click, it performs two actions:
  1.  **`setActiveViewNode(node)`:** Informs the `navigationState` which view the user wants to see next.
  2.  **`goto(href)`:** Triggers the navigation, relying on the `load` function to manage the context.

### **Centralized Logic: `hierarchyUtils.ts`**
To adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, all generic logic for manipulating and querying the hierarchy trees is consolidated in `hierarchyUtils.ts`.

---

## **Current Status and Detailed Implementation Plan**

This section documents the current project state and provides a precise, actionable plan to complete the refactoring.

### **Current Status**

*   **DONE (Design & Analysis):** The complete architectural model, based on parsing the `url.pathname`, has been defined and validated. The `navHierarchyConfig.ts` is correctly implemented.
*   **PENDING (Implementation):** The core logic components (`hierarchyUtils.ts`, `+layout.ts`, `navigationState.ts`) and some UI components (`buildBreadcrumb.ts`) are still in an **inconsistent and buggy state**, reflecting older, flawed architectural ideas.

### **Detailed and Actionable To-Do List**

This is the step-by-step plan to complete the refactoring. **The order is critical.**

#### **Step 1: Create Core Navigation Utilities (`hierarchyUtils.ts`)**

*The foundation must be solid. These functions must be created or corrected first.*

*   **Task 1.1: Create `getPrimitivePathFromUrl`**
    *   **Action:** Create a new function that takes the `url` object, splits the `pathname` into segments, and returns the primitive path array (e.g., `['suppliers', 3, 'categories']`).
*   **Task 1.2: Create `reconcilePaths`**
    *   **Action:** Create a new function that takes the `urlPrimitivePath` and `preservedPrimitivePath`. It must implement the core preservation/reset logic.
*   **Task 1.3: Create the Authoritative `findNodesForPath`**
    *   **Action:** Create the single, authoritative translation function. It must take a tree and a primitive path. It must traverse the tree by matching **string segments** to `item.key` and **numeric segments** to the corresponding entity/object node. It must return an array of original node references.
*   **Task 1.4: Verify `updateDisabledStates`**
    *   **Action:** The existing logic is likely correct. Once Task 1.3 is complete, test this function thoroughly to confirm it works as expected with the rich `nodesOnPath` input.
*   **Task 1.5: Remove Obsolete Functions**
    *   **Action:** Delete `buildNavContextPathFromUrl`, `extractLeafFromUrl`, and any other helpers based on the old `urlParams`-guessing logic.

#### **Step 2: Implement the Central Orchestrator (`+layout.ts`)**

*   **Task 2.1: Rebuild the `load` function**
    *   **Action:** Rewrite the `load` function to follow the exact step-by-step conceptual flow defined in this document, calling the new utility functions in the correct order.
*   **Task 2.2: Enhance and Verify `determineActiveNode`**
    *   **Action:** Modify this function to integrate leaf-node detection directly by inspecting the `url.pathname`'s last segment against the children of the last node in the `nodesOnPath`.

#### **Step 3: Update UI Components to Use Correct Data**

*   **Task 3.1: Fix Breadcrumb Generation**
    *   **Action:** Ensure the `buildBreadcrumb` function correctly iterates over the `nodesOnPath` it receives and uses the `item.type` property to decide between static labels and dynamic entity names.

#### **Step 4: Refactor State Management (`navigationState.ts`)**

*   **Task 4.1: Refactor `NavigationState` to Store Primitives**
    *   **Action:** Modify the `NavigationState` type definitions to store the path as `(string | number)[]` instead of `RuntimeHierarchyTreeNode[]`.
*   **Task 4.2: Adapt State Mutator Functions**
    *   **Action:** Review all functions like `selectNode` and `setActiveTreePath`. They must be updated to work with and store the new primitive path structure.

#### **Step 5: Final Review and System Test**

*   **Task:** After implementing all code changes, perform a full system test covering all navigation scenarios.

## **Architectural Goal: A Fully Data-Driven Navigation Hierarchy**

The declared goal is to refactor the navigation to be fully data-driven.

*   **Logic moves from Code to Data:** The hierarchy configuration becomes the single source of truth.
*   **Drastically Simplified Code:** Complex, manual logic in components will become obsolete.
*   **Enhanced Maintainability:** Future changes to the navigation flow will only require modifying the configuration data.

### **Example of the Target Configuration**
```typescript
export const supplierHierarchyConfig: HierarchyTree = {
  name: "suppliers",
  rootItem: createHierarchyNode({
    // LEVEL 0 (List)
    item: { key: "suppliers", type: "list", href: "/suppliers", label: "Suppliers" },
    children: [
      createHierarchyNode({
        // LEVEL 1 (Object) - Hidden, represents the selected supplier.
        item: { key: "supplier", type: "object", href: "/suppliers/[supplierId]", label: "Supplier", display: false, urlParamName: "supplierId" },
        defaultChild: "categories",
        children: [
          // ...and so on
        ],
      }),
    ],
  }),
};
```

### **Benefits of the Target Architecture**
*   **Logic moves from Code to Data:** The hierarchy configuration becomes the single source of truth.
*   **Drastically Simplified Code:** The complex, manual logic in `buildBreadcrumb.ts` will become obsolete. The breadcrumbs can follow the hierarchy exactly.
*   **Enhanced Maintainability:** Future changes to the navigation flow will only require modifying the configuration data. This makes the system far more robust and easier to extend.

### reconcilePaths - done
1. Purpose of the function:
To be the single, authoritative function that compares the user's immediate intent (urlPrimitivePath) with the application's memory (preservedPrimitivePath). It must correctly distinguish between three distinct scenarios: Context Preservation, Context Reset, and Context Deepening.
2. Function Signature (Inputs and Outputs):
Input 1: urlPrimitivePath: (string | number)[]
Input 2: preservedPrimitivePath: (string | number)[] | undefined
Output: (string | number)[] (The definitive primitive path)
3. The Definitive Conceptual Logic:
Handle Initial State: If there's no preservedPrimitivePath, the urlPrimitivePath is adopted by default.
Divergence Check: The function will iterate through both paths up to the length of the shorter path, comparing each segment.
If any segment differs (urlPath[i] !== preservedPath[i]), the paths have diverged. This is a Context Reset. The function must immediately return the new urlPrimitivePath.
Prefix Check (No Divergence Found): If the loop finishes without finding any differences, it means one path is a prefix of the other. Now we check the lengths to determine the outcome.
Case A: Context Preservation. If the urlPrimitivePath is shorter than the preservedPrimitivePath (urlPath.length < preservedPath.length), it means the user has navigated "up" the hierarchy. The function must return the longer preservedPrimitivePath.
Case B: Context Deepening / No Change. In all other cases (urlPath.length >= preservedPath.length), it means the user is either at the same location or navigating further down the same path. This is a Context Deepening. The new, longer (or same-length) urlPrimitivePath becomes the new source of truth. The function must return the urlPrimitivePath.
Example to be remembered for the README (Context Deepening):
urlPrimitivePath: ['suppliers', 1, 'categories', 2, 'offerings', 5]
preservedPrimitivePath: ['suppliers', 1, 'categories', 2]
Check: The paths do not diverge. The urlPrimitivePath is longer.
Result: The function returns the urlPrimitivePath, correctly deepening the context.

# getPrimitivePathFromUrl - done

# findNodesForPath - done
Conceptual Logic:
Initialization:
Validate that primitivePath is not empty and its first segment matches the rootItem.key. If not, throw an error.
nodesOnPath = [tree.rootItem]
currentNode = tree.rootItem
Loop through the rest of the path segments (from index 1 to the end):
segment = primitivePath[i]
nextNode = undefined (The node we hope to find in this iteration)
Find the nextNode based on the type of segment:
Case A: The segment is a string (e.g., "categories")
Search through currentNode.children.
The nextNode is the first child where child.item.key === segment.
If no such child is found after checking all children, the path is invalid. Throw an error (e.g., Path validation failed: segment '${segment}' not found).
Case B: The segment is a number (e.g., 3)
Search through currentNode.children.
The nextNode is the first child where child.item.type === 'object'.
If no child of type object is found, it means the hierarchy at this point does not accept an ID. The path is invalid. Throw an error (e.g., Path validation failed: numeric ID '${segment}' is not allowed here).
If a nextNode was successfully found:
Add the nextNode to the nodesOnPath array.
Update the pointer for the next iteration: currentNode = nextNode.
After the loop finishes, return nodesOnPath. If the loop completes without throwing an error, the URL path has been fully validated against the hierarchy structure.
How This Solves All Problems:
Your Edge Case (/suppliers/1):
currentNode is suppliers. Next segment is 1 (number).
The algorithm looks for a child of suppliers with type: "object".
It finds the supplier node. This becomes the nextNode. The path is valid. Correct.
Your Other Edge Case (/suppliers/addresses/1):
currentNode is addresses. Next segment is 1 (number).
The algorithm looks for a child of addresses with type: "object".
The addresses node has no children. No object child is found.
The algorithm throws an error. The URL is correctly identified as invalid. Correct.
Agnosticism: The algorithm doesn't enforce a strict list -> object pattern. If an object node had another object node as a child, the logic would still work correctly as long as the URL provided another numeric ID.
