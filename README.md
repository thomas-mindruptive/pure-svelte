Of course. This is an excellent idea. Here is a comprehensive, detailed summary of the current state of your SvelteKit application. This summary is structured to serve as a perfect starting point for a new conversation, providing all the necessary context, code, and architectural decisions we've made.

### **Project Summary: A Data Management Web Application**

#### **1. Core Objective**

The goal is to build a web application for managing business data, specifically "Suppliers" (Wholesalers) and their related information. The application needs to handle thousands of records efficiently, providing a fast user experience for viewing, creating, and editing data. The architecture must be robust, maintainable, and avoid unnecessary database load.

#### **2. Technology Stack & Key Libraries**

*   **Framework:** SvelteKit
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
*   **Styling:** Global CSS with CSS Variables (`src/app.css`) and component-scoped styles.
*   **Key Libraries:**
    *   `mssql`: The Node.js driver for connecting to the SQL Server.
    *   `uuid`: For generating unique transaction keys to ensure multi-tab safety.
    *   `lodash-es`: For utility functions like `debounce` to improve UX in search fields.

#### **3. Core Architectural Decisions & Patterns**

1.  **Generic Query API (`/api/query`):** Instead of creating dedicated API endpoints for every data request, we have a single, powerful, and secure generic endpoint. It accepts a JSON `QueryPayload` object that describes the desired query (`select`, `from`, `where`, `orderBy`). This keeps the backend DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and flexible.
2.  **Universal `load` Function (`+page.ts`):** The main supplier list page (`/suppliers`) uses a universal `load` function. This function runs on the server for the initial page load (SSR) and in the browser for subsequent client-side navigation. This is the central point for defining the data requirements of the page.
3.  **URL-Driven State:** The state of the supplier list (filtering, sorting, pagination) is stored directly in the URL's search parameters (e.g., `/suppliers?filter=ACME&sort=name`). This makes the application state bookmarkable, shareable, and robust.
4.  **"Create, Redirect, and Hydrate" Pattern:** To create new suppliers without re-fetching the entire list from the database, we use a dedicated `/suppliers/new` page.
    *   The `create` action on this page saves the new supplier to the DB.
    *   It then stores the newly created record in a short-lived, unique cookie.
    *   It redirects the user back to the `/suppliers` list page with a unique key in the URL.
    *   The list page's client-side script (`onMount`) checks for this key, "consumes" the data from the cookie, and dynamically injects the new record into the displayed list. This is performant and multi-tab safe.
5.  **Reusable, "Dumb" Components:** A generic `Datagrid.svelte` component is used to display data. It is purely presentational; it receives rows and column definitions as props and emits events (like `on:sort`), but has no knowledge of where the data comes from.

```

#### **5. Current Status & Functionality**

*   **Supplier List (`/suppliers`):**
    *   Displays a list of suppliers in a sortable, scrollable `Datagrid`.
    *   Data is loaded server-side for the initial view.
    *   Features a client-side filter input that dynamically re-queries the data via the `/api/query` endpoint without a full page reload.
    *   Sorting is also handled client-side by updating the URL and re-querying.
    *   Contains a link to `/suppliers/new`.
*   **New Supplier Page (`/suppliers/new`):**
    *   Presents a form to create a new supplier.
    *   Upon submission, it saves the data via a server-side `action`.
    *   On success, it redirects back to the `/suppliers` list. The list page then intelligently adds the new record to the UI without re-fetching the entire list.
*   **Edit Supplier Page (`/suppliers/[id]`):**
    *   Loads and displays all data for a single, existing supplier.
    *   Allows editing and saving of master data.
    *   Includes a fully functional section for managing the n:m relationship to `product_categories`, including adding and removing categories.
    *   Correctly handles and displays user-friendly error messages (e.g., when trying to remove a category that is still in use).
*   **UI Notifications:** A global "snackbar" system is in place to provide feedback for successful actions or errors.

# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
